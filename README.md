# Ionic Capacitor Resources Generator
Copy asset resources generated by [cordiva-res](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-res) into Android and iOS platform folders in a Capacitor project.

## Install

```shell
npm install -g @d4h/capacitor-res
```

## Description

This script derives from [this gist from dalezak](https://gist.github.com/rrlevy/16d42f94decd3b82bed4ac00da79f2f2), which in turn comes from given in [ionic-team/capacitor#229](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/issues/229#issuecomment-538146260). The original script as given didn't work too well in the context of a monorepo project, as it expected platform and asset folders to lie at the project root.

## Use

```shell
cd path/to/project/
cordova-res <platform>
capacitor-res <platform>
```
